# High School Java Projects

This repository contains a collection of Java projects I created during my high school years when I was first learning to program. These projects showcase my early journey into software development, featuring a variety of applications including games, utilities, and educational tools.

To run these Java projects, you'll need:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Version 8 or higher recommended
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** - For running compiled programs
- A Java IDE such as:
  - IntelliJ IDEA
  - Eclipse
  - Visual Studio Code with Java extensions
  - NetBeans

### Installation

1. **Install Java JDK:**
   - Download from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use OpenJDK
   - Verify installation by running `java -version` and `javac -version` in your terminal

2. **Clone or download this repository**

3. **Compile and run projects:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to a project directory
   cd Calculator/src
   
   # Compile the Java files
   javac *.java
   
   # Run the main class
   java Calculator
   ```

### Calculator
A comprehensive calculator application with GUI interface supporting:
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, ^)
- Fraction calculations with automatic simplification
- Complex expressions with multiple operations
- Interactive button-based input
- Menu system for calculations

### Games

#### Flappy Bird
A Java implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game featuring:
- Bird physics and collision detection
- Pipe generation and movement
- Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Moderate, Difficult)
- Score tracking and game over mechanics
- Custom graphics and animations

#### Space Invaders
A classic arcade-style space shooter with:
- Multiple alien tiers with different health levels
- Player ship movement and shooting mechanics
- Power-ups (extra life, faster movement, scattershot)
- Wave-based progression system
- Score and kill tracking

#### Hangman
A word guessing game featuring:
- Dictionary-based word selection
- Progressive hangman drawing
- Multiple difficulty modes
- Letter tracking and validation
- Custom graphics for hangman states

#### Stack Game
A precision-based stacking game where players must:
- Stack falling blocks with perfect timing
- Maintain balance as the stack grows
- Progress through increasing difficulty levels
- Master the physics of block placement

### Music Applications

#### Piano Simulator
An interactive piano application with:
- 7-key piano interface (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)
- Real piano sound samples (.wav files)
- Keyboard input mapping (number keys 1-7)
- Visual piano representation

#### Piano Typer
An enhanced piano application with:
- Extended key range
- Multiple sound files
- Improved audio handling
- Better user interface

### Creative Tools

#### Drawing Board
A digital drawing application featuring:
- Multiple color options (black, brown, orange, yellow, red, purple, green, blue)
- Different brush sizes
- Eraser functionality
- Real-time mouse tracking
- Clear canvas option

### Utility Applications

#### Debate Practice Log
A student management system for debate practice tracking:
- Student check-in/check-out functionality
- Time tracking for practice sessions
- Officer designation system
- Report generation
- Member status display with color coding

### Educational Projects

#### Computer Science Labs
A collection of programming exercises and data structure implementations:
- Binary search trees
- Linked lists
- Sorting algorithms
- File I/O operations
- Mathematical computations (Fibonacci, prime numbers)
- Roman numeral math
- Tax calculation systems

#### Labs
Additional programming exercises covering:
- Encryption/decryption algorithms
- File search functionality
- Movement simulation
- Data structure implementations

## Technical Design

### Architecture
- **GUI Framework:** Java Swing for all graphical applications
- **Audio:** Java Sound API for piano applications
- **File I/O:** Standard Java file handling for data persistence
- **Graphics:** Custom image handling and scaling

## Notes

- Some projects may require specific image or audio files to run properly
- The code reflects my learning journey and may not follow all best practices

*These projects represent my early programming journey and showcase the evolution of my coding skills throughout high school. Each project was a stepping stone in learning Java and software development fundamentals.*
